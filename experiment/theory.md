## Wave Nature of Light

Light exhibits a **dual nature** — it behaves both as:

1.  **Particle** (photon)
2.  **Wave** (electromagnetic wave)

When light interacts with obstacles or openings comparable to its wavelength ($\lambda$), it bends around the edges. This phenomenon is known as **diffraction**.

### Key properties of waves that light exhibits:
* Diffraction
* Interference
* Superposition
* Polarization

These behaviors form the basis of this experiment.

## 1. Single-Slit Diffraction

When monochromatic light passes through a narrow slit of width $a$, it spreads out and forms a diffraction pattern on the screen.

### (i) Condition for Minima (Dark Fringes)

$$a \sin\theta = m\lambda \quad (m = \pm1, \pm2, \pm3, \ldots)$$

**Where:**
* $a$ $\rightarrow$ slit width
* $\lambda$ $\rightarrow$ wavelength of light
* $\theta$ $\rightarrow$ angular position of minima
* $m$ $\rightarrow$ diffraction order

### (ii)  Linear Fringe Position on Screen

If the screen is at distance $D$ from the slit:

$$y = \frac{m\lambda D}{a}$$

### (iii) Key Observations

* **Central maximum:** Brightest and twice as wide as other maxima.
* **Side maxima:** Much weaker and decrease in intensity.
* **Higher-order maxima:** Spread further apart as $m$ increases.
* **Effect of Slit/Wavelength:**
    * Narrower slit $\rightarrow$ wider diffraction pattern.
    * Longer wavelength $\rightarrow$ greater spreading.

> **Note:** This experiment demonstrates the wave nature of light and diffraction due to a single aperture.

## 2. Double-Slit Interference (Young’s Experiment)

When coherent light passes through two slits separated by distance $d$, the waves overlap and interfere.

### 1. Fringe Width

$$\beta = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$

**Where:**
* $\beta$ $\rightarrow$ fringe width
* $\lambda$ $\rightarrow$ wavelength
* $D$ $\rightarrow$ screen distance
* $d$ $\rightarrow$ distance between slits

### 2. Interference Pattern

**Bright Fringes (Constructive Interference)**
$$\Delta \text{path} = n\lambda$$

**Dark Fringes (Destructive Interference)**
$$\Delta \text{path} = (2n+1)\frac{\lambda}{2}$$

### 3. Significance
1.  Confirms the **wave nature of light**.
2.  Supports **Huygens’ Principle**.
3.  Demonstrates **superposition of waves**.

## 3. Electron Double-Slit Experiment (Quantum Theory)

This modern experiment shows that matter also behaves like waves (matter waves or de Broglie waves).

### 1. Key Observations

* **Electrons fired one at a time still produce an interference pattern.**
    * $\rightarrow$ Shows electrons behave like **probability waves**.
* **If we measure which slit the electron passes through:**
    * The interference pattern *disappears*.
    * Only two clump patterns remain.
    * $\rightarrow$ Measurement collapses the wave function.

**Wave–Particle Duality:**
* Electrons behave like **particles** when detected.
* But behave like **waves** when propagating.

### 2. Implications
* Supports **de Broglie hypothesis**.
* Demonstrates **quantum superposition**.
* Shows **observer effect / wave function collapse**.
* Reveals that nature at the microscopic level is **probabilistic**, not deterministic.
