AIM
To study the behaviour of classical particles, classical waves, and quantum objects towards the double slit by using the following three physical models:
1.	Double-Slit Diffraction (Classical Particles: Sand)
To observe how particles passing through a narrow opening form a spread-out pattern, illustrating the idea of diffraction in a classical context.
2.	Double-Slit (Young’s) Interference (Classical Wave: Water)
To investigate how water waves passing through two slits interfere to form a pattern of alternating constructive and destructive interference.
3.	Quantum Interpretation (Quantum Object: Electron or Photon) 
To explore how quantum particles such as electrons or photons exhibit wave–particle duality and reproduce interference patterns—even when fired one at a time.


THEORY
Wave Nature of Light
Light exhibits a dual nature — it behaves both as:
1.	Particle (photon)
2.	Wave (electromagnetic wave)
When light interacts with obstacles or openings comparable to its wavelength(λ), it bends around the edges. This phenomenon is known as diffraction.

Key properties of waves that light exhibits:
	Diffraction
	Interference
	Superposition
	Polarization
These behaviours form the basis of this experiment.
	Single-Slit Diffraction: 
When monochromatic light passes through a narrow slit of width a, it spreads out and forms a diffraction pattern on the screen as Fig 1.
(i) Condition for Minima (Dark Fringes)
a.Sin(θ)=mλ (m=0,1,2…)                                                (1) 
Where:
a = Slit width
λ = Wavelength of light
θ = Angular position of minima
m = Diffraction order
(ii) Linear Fringe Position on Screen
If the screen is at distance D from the slit:
                                       y=mDλ/a                                                      (2)
(iii) Key Observations
	Central maximum: Brightest and twice as wide as other maxima.
	Side maxima: Much weaker and decrease in intensity.
	Higher-order maxima: Spread further apart as $m$ increases.
	Effect of Slit/Wavelength:
	Narrower slit → wider diffraction pattern.
	Longer wavelength → greater spreading.
Note: This experiment demonstrates the wave nature of light and diffraction due to a double aperture.
2. Double-Slit Interference (Young’s Experiment):
When coherent light passes through two slits separated by distance “d”, the waves overlap and interfere.

	 Fringe Width
    β=λx/d
Where:
𝛽 = Fringe width 
λ = Wavelength of wave 
d = Distance between the slits 
x = Distance from slits to the screen 
	 Interference Pattern
Dark Fringes (Destructive Interference) 
∆(Path difference )=(2m+1)λ/2
Bright Fringes (Constructive Interference) 
∆(Path difference )=mλ

1.3	 Significance
1.	Confirms the wave nature of light.
2.	Supports Huygens’ Principle.
3.	Demonstrates superposition of waves.

3. Electron Double-Slit Experiment (Quantum Theory):
This modern experiment shows that matter also behaves like waves (matter waves or de Broglie waves).
i.	Key Observations
•	Electrons fired one at a time still produce an interference pattern, which shows electrons behave like probability waves.
•	If we measure which slit the electron passes through (with detector):
o	The interference pattern disappears.
o	Only two clump patterns remain (each corresponding to one slit). 
o	The electron behaves like a classical particle.
Wave–Particle Duality:
•	 Electrons behave like particles when detected.
•	 But behave like waves when propagating.
ii.	Implications
•	 Supports de Broglie hypothesis.
•	 Demonstrates quantum superposition.
•	 Shows observer effect / wave function collapse.
•	 Reveals that nature at the microscopic level is probabilistic, not deterministic.

PROCEDURE
Wave-Particle Duality Experiments
This guide outlines the steps to perform virtual experiments comparing Classical Particles, Classical Waves, and Quantum Objects.
1. Double Slit – Classical Particles (Sand)
Objective
To observe how particles such as sand pass through two slits and form a distribution pattern on the screen.
Steps
1.	Open Experiment: Select "Experiment 1: Classical Particles–Sand".
2.	Observe the Setup:
o	A sand container at the top.
o	Two slits (Slit 1 and Slit 2).
o	A screen at the bottom.
3.	Action: Click “Start Sand Flow”.
4.	Observation: Sand begins to fall through both slits.
5.	Watch: Observe how the sand accumulates on the screen.
6.	Analyze: 
o	Click “Show Graph” to view the Intensity Distribution Graph.
o	You will see two hump-shaped distributions as shown in Fig. 2.
o	There are no interference fringes because the sand behaves like classical particles.
7.	Controls:
o	Click “Stop Sand Flow” to end.
o	Click “Reset Simulation” to run again.
Expected Observation: The screen shows two independent piles of sand, representing classical particle behaviour — No Wave	Interference.

2. Double Slit – Classical Waves (Water)
Objective
To observe interference patterns produced by water waves passing through two slits.
Steps
1.	Open Experiment: Select "Experiment 2: Classical Wave –Water".
2.	Observe the Setup:
o	A wave source (needle).
o	A barrier (wall) with two slits.
o	A screen.
3.	Action: Click “Start” to generate circular water waves.
4.	Watch: Waves reach the barrier and pass through the slits. Observe the overlapping wavefronts—this creates interference.
5.	Adjust Parameters (Optional):
o	Wave Frequency
o	Wave Amplitude
o	Slit Separation
o	Slit Width
6.	Analyze: Click “Show Intensity Graph” to display the interference pattern.
7.	Observation: You will observe alternating bright and dark fringes with a symmetric pattern as shown Fig. 3.
8.	Controls: Click “Stop” to pause and “Reset” to start over.
Expected Observation: A clear interference pattern appears, proving that water behaves as a Classical Wave.

3.	Quantum Object – Electron or Photon
Objective
To observe interference produced by quantum particles even when fired one at a time.
Steps
1.	Open Experiment: Select "Experiment 3: Quantum Object – Electron or Photon".
2.	Observe the Setup: You will see a black screen where particle hits will appear.
3.	Configure:

o	Particle Count: Choose the number of particles using the "Electrons" dropdown.
o	Adjust Parameters: Change slit separation “d” or screen distance “D” if need.
4.	Action: Click the play button to start releasing electrons/photons.
5.	Watch:
o	Observe individual dots appearing randomly.
o	As more particles accumulate, a wave-like interference pattern emerges as shown in Fig. 4.
6.	Controls: Use Pause, Step-forward, or Restart for detailed observation.
Expected Observation: Even though particles hit the screen one by one, the accumulated pattern shows interference fringes, which is the evidence of Wave–Particle Duality.

3.1 Quantum Object with Detector 
Objective
To study the effect of observation on quantum interference (The Observer Effect).
Steps
1.	Open Experiment: Select "Quantum Particle with Detector".
2.	Observe the Setup: Detectors are now placed at the slits to track which slit each particle passes through.
3.	Configure: 
o	Choose the number of particles.
o	Adjust other parameters (If need).
4.	Action: Click play button to begin sending electrons/photons. 
5.	Watch:
o	Because the detector identifies the slit, no interference fringe builds up.
o	Only two bright particle clusters appear on the screen as shown in Fig. 5.
6.	Analyze: After sufficient particles, observe that the final pattern resembles the "Sand" experiment.
Expected Observation: When the slit is measured, the interference disappears. This proves the Observer Effect — measurement collapses the wave function.
